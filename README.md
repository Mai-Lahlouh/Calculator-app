# Calculator Web App

## Overview

This project is a responsive calculator web application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app is built using React and features a theme-switching functionality that allows users to toggle between different themes. The calculator also handles decimal numbers and ensures correct display even when the input exceeds the screen width.

## Features

- **Decimal Handling:** Allows decimal inputs and prevents invalid multiple decimal points within the same number.
- **Theme Switcher:** Users can switch between different themes.
- **Scrollable Display:** If the input exceeds the screen width, it becomes scrollable horizontally.
- **Error Handling:** Displays `ERROR` for invalid operations.
- **Reset and Delete Functions:** Users can reset the entire input or delete the last character.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS:** For styling the calculator and implementing responsive design.
