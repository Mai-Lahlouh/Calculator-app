# Calculator Web App

## Overview

This project is a responsive calculator web application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app is built using React and features a theme-switching functionality that allows users to toggle between different themes. The calculator also handles decimal numbers and ensures correct display even when the input exceeds the screen width.
